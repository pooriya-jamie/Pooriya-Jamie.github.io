Hello thereðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Pooriya Jamie, a computer science enthusiast with a deep passion for machine learning, data science, human-computer interaction (HCI), and algorithm theory. My academic journey has equipped me with invaluable experiences, particularly as a research assistant in both ML and HCI.

In the realm of HCI, I am especially interested in learning sciences, student modeling, and enhancing education through technology, with a special focus on AI-based solutions. I am proficient in C++ and Python, bringing strong analytical and problem-solving skills to every challenge. I thrive on tackling complex problems and am always on the lookout for innovative solutions.

If youâ€™re interested in collaborating on research or educational projects, Iâ€™d love to connect. Letâ€™s explore how our shared interests and expertise can create exciting opportunities in these dynamic fields.
